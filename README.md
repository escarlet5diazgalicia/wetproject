## Project Management Template

This is a tentative template for managing an experimental project via gitHub. The important sections are:

  1. Protocols: collected in [protocols folder](protocols)

  2. Sequences: collected in [sequences folder](sequences)

  3. Project Management Board: see the [Projects section](https://github.com/graik/wetproject/projects) on github

  4. Customized templates for the [issue tracker](https://github.com/graik/wetproject/issues)

  5. Low-key web site: edit pages in [docs folder](docs), access it under https://graik.github.io/wetproject/

### Tentative Workflow

Example cards and issues are supposed to show how this can be useful. A more detailed description how the workflow *could* look like is given here: [suggested workflow](suggested_workflow.md)

 
### Creating your own experimental project

  1. Fork this repository (see `Fork` Button up right)
  
  2. Copy the project board -- [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/copying-a-project-board/)
  
      - navigate to the original project board (in this repo)
      - open `Menu` (upper right)
      - click the *** (the three dots for additional options)
      - select `copy` and chose your new repository as a destination

  3. Adapt the links in this `README.md` to point to your new project rather than the template
  
  4. Issue templates will be copied but [Issue labels](https://github.com/graik/wetproject/labels) won't -- re-create the labels manually
  
Note: protocols could also be shared between repositories if we decide to merge modifications back to the original repository using pull requests. This will not affect issue tracking and project boards, which will remain separate. However, the simple website in [docs](docs) will be affected -- merging things back and forth, would mean that we cannot have different websites for each repository, which shouldn't really be a problem though.
